I'm a frontend engineer with a passion for building things on the open web. I work mostly with **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and **Astro**, and I care a lot about developer experience, performance, and making useful tools that other developers actually enjoy using.

Over the years I've shipped [ngb.email](https://ngb.email) — a fully customizable, open-source drag-and-drop email template editor for Angular, integrated with MJML and TailwindCSS — and [tailwind-astro-starting-blog](https://github.com/wanoo21/tailwind-astro-starting-blog), a popular Astro + Tailwind blog starter with hundreds of GitHub stars.

I find the intersection of **tooling**, **developer productivity**, and **great UX** most interesting. When I'm not building, I'm thinking about how to improve the tools I already have.

This blog is where I write about things I learn, build, and think about. Mostly frontend, sometimes architecture, occasionally things that just won't fit in a tweet.
